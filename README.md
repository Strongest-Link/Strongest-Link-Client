* `npm run build` to make a production build of the app.
* `npm test` to run tests.

### Deploy

The client side is currently deployed at https://strongest-link.netlify.app/

## Project Goal

Build a multiplayer quiz game website where users can make lobbies and take turns answering trivia questions.

### Other requirements

* Users should be able to choose the level and topic for their quiz game.
* User scores should be stored in a database at the end of the game.
* Leaderboard where users can see high scores.

## Design & Implementation

The main idea behind the design of the client side was that it should be a single-page web application with dynamically updating content, so [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/) was used.
